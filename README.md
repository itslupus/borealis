# bOrEaLiS
This project is the frontend portion of a larger project. This frontend is the result of me learning ReactJS.
## Prereq
This project requires the backend part of this project which can be found on my Github.
## Build  
* `clone`
* `npm install`
## Run
Copy the contents of the build directory into your web server. The backend then needs to go into a directory named `api` in the same location.
